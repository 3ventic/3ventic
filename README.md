# Hi!

I'm a software development engineer originally from Finland currently working for [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/3v), where among other things I help maintain [Twirp](https://github.com/twitchtv/twirp). The projects on my GitHub are small personal projects I've written to make my life easier. Feel free to browse, use, and improve them within the bounds of their licenses.
